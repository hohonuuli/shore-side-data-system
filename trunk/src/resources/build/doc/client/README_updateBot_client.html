<h1>Usage of SSDS UpdateBot Application</h1>
This java application will connect up to the SSDS database and
crawl the metadata looking for things it can do to enforce rules
and business logic inside SSDS (aligning parent/child start times,
etc.)  It is run from the command line using:
<pre>java -jar ssds-updatebot-client.jar</pre>
If you have any questions, please contact us at: ssds@mbari.org
