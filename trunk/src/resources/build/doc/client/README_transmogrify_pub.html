<h1>Usage of SSDS Publisher JARs</h1>
Welcome to the publisher libraries for the Shore-Side Data System. For your 
convenience all the jar files that you need to publish JMS packets to
SSDS are included in this zip file.  You need to make sure that you include
all these jars in your Java project and MORE IMPORTANTLY, make sure they
are in the correct classpath order.  The correct class path order is:
<pre>@TRANSMOGRIFY_CLASSPATH@</pre>
If you have any questions, please contact ssds@mbari.org.<br/>

Enjoy,
