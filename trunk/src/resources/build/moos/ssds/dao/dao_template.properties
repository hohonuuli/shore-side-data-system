# Ethernet Address (MAC) of machine where services is running.
# This is used by the DeviceDAO class to generate UUID's for
# devices.  If this is left empty, it will dynamically try to
# find the host MAC address, but this is not always supported,
# so if it can't find one, it will just generate a random MAC
# address and use that.
