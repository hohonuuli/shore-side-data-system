The SSDS Perl module README.

With SSDS.pm you may work with MBARI's Shore Side Data System metadata in 
an object oriented fashion to access and update SSDS metadata.  The module 
is built upon the MetadataAccessServlet web service and most methods and
properties that are available through the java API are availble through 
this Perl API.  

Installation involves simply extracting the SSDS.pm file to a location where
your Perl scripts may use it.  Here is a sample usage script that does
something useful:

# ------------------------------- Example Script -------------------------------------

use SSDS;
use POSIX;

$ssds = new SSDS();
$ssds->ssdsServer('@CLIENT_TOOL_PERL_MODULE_HTTP_SERVER_BASE@');

my $dpAccess = new SSDS::DataProducerAccess();
print "Using SSDS server " . $dpAccess->ssdsServer . "\n";

#
# Find top-level CIMT mooring deployment and print all its children
#
my $deplName = 'CIMT Mooring Deployment';
print "Looking for DataProducer(s) named '$deplName'...\n";
my $moorDepls = $dpAccess->findByName($deplName, 'true', 'name', 'false');

processDeployments($moorDepls);

exit 0;

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Recursively get child DataProducers from the passed DataProducers and
# pass off Instrument role Deployments.

sub processDeployments {

        my $depls = $_[0];

        $indent .= "  ";
        
        #
        # findByName methods return a reference to a list, iterate through that list
        #
        foreach my $d ( @{$depls} ) {
                $monYr = POSIX::strftime("%b %Y", POSIX::gmtime(($d->startDateAsEsecs)
                        ? $d->startDateAsEsecs : 0) );
                $betterDeplName = $d->getDevice->name . " - " . $monYr;
                my $role = (defined $d->role) ? $d->role : '';
                my $name = (defined $d->name) ? $d->name : "SSDS ID " . $d->getDevice->id;
                
                print $indent . "\"" . $name . "\" as $role ($betterDeplName)\n";
                
                my $childDepls = $dpAccess->findChildDataProducers($d, 'startDate', 'false');

                #
                # Call myself again until I run out of children
                #
                processDeployments($childDepls);
        }
        $indent =~ s/  $//;

} # End processDeployments()

# ------------------------------- End Example Script ---------------------------------

Please see perlSSDSmodule.html and testSSDS.pl files for further documentation and examples.

In particular testSSDS.pl contains a function named addProcessRunToSSDS() that you may
want to copy into your script to facilitate submitting processed data back to SSDS.
