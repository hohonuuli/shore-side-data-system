<h1>Usage of SSDS Ingest Publisher JAR</h1>
Welcome to the ingest publisher libraries for the Shore-Side Data System. For your 
convenience all the jar files that you need to publish JMS packets <b>in SSDS format</b> to
SSDS are included in this zip file.  You need to make sure that you include
all these jars in your Java project and MORE IMPORTANTLY, make sure they
are in the correct classpath order.  The correct class path order is:
<pre>@INGEST_CLASSPATH@</pre>

<p>There are two classes in these jar files that can be used for publishing SSDS formatted packets 
to the ingest component of the SSDS.  They are <code>moos.ssds.jms.PacketGenerator</code> 
and <code>moos.ssds.jms.PublisherComponent</code></p>

<h3>PacketGenerator</h3>
<p>This class is intended to be used from the command line and is helpful in publishing small numbers
of packets.  Packets that are sent to SSDS basically have a couple of byte payloads and a handful of
parameters that tell SSDS where this packet is coming from.  In order to use the PacketGenerator, make
a copy of the packet-generator-ingest-template.properties file and then edit that copy to
setup all the properties as you need to.  The template file documents the properties pretty well and
you can just consult the template file for instructions on how to fill out the various properties.
</p>

<p>After constructing the properties files and any other files that will be used for payloads, run the PacketGenerator
in the following manner from the command line</p>
<pre>
prompt&gt; java -cp @INGEST_CLASSPATH@ moos.ssds.jms.PacketGenerator packet.properties
</pre>
<p>
where the packet.properites files is the file that you generated from the template.
</p>
<h3>PublisherComponent</h3>
<p>This class is used within Java code to help you in sending <b>SSDS formatted</b> byte arrays to the SSDS ingest component.  You must use the classpath specified above in your code.  An example of a class that publishes a packet to SSDS in SSDS format is shown here (source is included in zip as well):</p>
<pre>
import java.util.Date;

import moos.ssds.io.util.PacketUtility;
import moos.ssds.jms.PublisherComponent;

public class ExampleSSDSIngestClientPublisher {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// The component for publishing to SSDS
		PublisherComponent publisherComponent = new PublisherComponent();
		// Create the various parameters for the packet
		long sourceID = 101;
		long parentID = 100;
		// The type of packet to be sent Data = 0, Metadata = 1, Device Message
		// = 4
		int packetType = 0;
		// This is the record type
		long packetSubType = 1;
		long metadataSequenceNumber = 0;
		long dataDescriptionVersion = 0;
		Date now = new Date();
		// TODO kgomes this needs to be change after but SSDS-77 is fixed
		long timestampSeconds = now.getTime() / 1000;
		long timestampNanoseconds = (now.getTime() % 1000) * 1000;
		long sequenceNumber = 1;
		byte[] firstBuffer = "Sensor Data First Buffer".getBytes();
		byte[] secondBuffer = "SensorData Second Buffer (ignored)".getBytes();

		// Create and publish the byte array in SSDS format
		publisherComponent.publishBytes(PacketUtility
				.createSSDSFormatByteArray(sourceID, parentID, packetType,
						packetSubType, metadataSequenceNumber,
						dataDescriptionVersion, timestampSeconds,
						timestampNanoseconds, sequenceNumber, firstBuffer,
						secondBuffer));
	}
}
