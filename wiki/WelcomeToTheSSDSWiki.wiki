The Shore Side Data System (SSDS) software is a J2EE application that was built by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) to serve as both a data storage and catalog for streaming instrument data as well as a catalog for any other URL accessible data and resources that are related to data products and processes.  Using client libraries, users can also instrument their processes to register information and resources with the SSDS so that data provenance (data product lineage) can be tracked.  This allows users to see the ancestors and descendants of various data products and resources that are registered in the SSDS.  It was originally built to support MBARI's ocean observatory efforts, but soon grew to support many other operational assets at MBARI.

These pages are the main source of documentation for the Shore-Side Data System Project.  You will find information about the design, development, deployment and use of the Shore-Side Data System software.
