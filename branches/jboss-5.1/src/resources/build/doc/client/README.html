	<h1>Usage of SSDS Client Libraries</h1>
	Welcome to the client libraries for the Shore-Side Data System. For
	your convenience all the jar files that you need to interact remotely
	with the SSDS are included in this zip file. You need to make sure that
	you include all these jars in your Java project and MORE IMPORTANTLY,
	make sure they are in the correct classpath order. The correct class
	path order is:
	<pre>@CLIENT_CLASSPATH@</pre>

	<h3>UpdateBot Client</h3>
	This java application will connect up to the SSDS database and crawl
	the metadata looking for things it can do to enforce rules and business
	logic inside SSDS (aligning parent/child start times, etc.) It is run
	from the command line using:
	<pre>java -cp @UPDATEBOT_CLASSPATH@ @UPDATEBOT_MAIN_CLASS_STATEMENT@</pre>

	<h3>Graphing Client</h3>
	This java application will connect up to the SSDS database, read the
	graphing configurations (which instruments, time intervals, variables,
	etc.) and builds plots using JFreeChart. It is run from the command
	line using:
	<pre>java -cp @GRAPHING_CLASSPATH@ @GRAPHING_MAIN_CLASS_STATEMENT@</pre>

	<br /> If you have any questions, please contact ssds@mbari.org.
	<br />
	<p>Enjoy,</p>
	<p>The SSDS Development Team</p>
